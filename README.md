<!-- Replace this with whatever GIF tool you used! -->
GIF created with ffmpeg. Split into four because the files were too large to preview on GitHub.
<!-- Recommended tools:
[Kap](https://getkap.co/) for macOS
[ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for Windows
[peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for Linux. -->

## Notes

I had a lot of difficulty embedding the gif to GitHub because of what I assume are size limitations. I had to split the gif.
